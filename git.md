# Git
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. This is software used to track changes in files over time. Git is commonly used in programming to manage a project's source code. Git allows us to keep our code safe as it changes, committing changes to a repository. The repository can be used to revert to any previous commits as well as track where changes were made and by whom. Git is incredibly important and ubiquitous in programming. 

## GitHub & GitLab
GitHub and GitLab, not to be confused with Git itself, are online services that work with Git software to maintain your Git repos. Git is software, GitHub and GitLab are web services. We will use GitHub in this class as our Git repository service.
