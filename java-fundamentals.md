# Java Fundamentals
  
## Inheritance
In Java, a class inherits data and behavior from a parent class using the `extends` keyword. A class can only extend one other class. Java is a language that only supports "single-inheritance". In fact every class (except one) in Java inherits from exactly one parent class. If a class is not specified with `extends` then it implicitly extends the `Object` class. The only class which does not have a parent is the `Object` class itself. **`Object` is the class from which all other Java classes are derived.**
