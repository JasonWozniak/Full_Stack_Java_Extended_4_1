# To Do App
We will be building and refactoring a simple to-do list application throughout the first two weeks of training. The app we build can be found here in this repository.

## Technology
We want to practice the basic technologies we will touch upon in the first two weeks of training. To that end the to-do app will utilize:
 - Java - Back end
 - JavaScript - Front end
 - HTML - Front end
 - Servlets - API endpoints
 - MariaDB - Data persistence 
 - CSS - UI styling
 - Bootstrap - UI Styling

## Features / User Stories
### Week 1 - Console App
We want to be able to view a list of to-do items.  
We want to be able to mark to-do items complete.  
We want to be able to add to-do items.  
We want to include due dates on to-do items.  

### Week 2 - Client/Server with UI
We want to refactor the app to be web-based instead of console-based.
